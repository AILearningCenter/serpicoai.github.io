## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial Astro-based static site foundation: shared layout, all page
  routes, SEO basics (sitemap, robots.txt, canonical/OG tags), and a
  minimal local preview server.
- Git repository initialized with `main`/`dev` branches.
- Repo hygiene: `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.editorconfig`.
- Real site logo (header mark + hero graphic), favicon, and footer social
  links (LinkedIn, YouTube, Meetup, Facebook) migrated from the source Wix
  site into `public/assets/` and wired into `Header.astro`, `BaseLayout.astro`,
  `Hero.astro`, and `Footer.astro`.
- `public/assets/` now also holds 38 additional approved-but-not-yet-wired
  images (team headshots, services photography, partner logos, about-page
  photos) awaiting real page copy before they can be placed.
